# NUP Roles for FIMS-AZ

UTM_AUTHORITY:
    description: |
        A small set of trusted users who manage identities of all core UTM
        components such as USSs.
    authority: ANSP
    examples:
        - "UTM Authority vets USS1's additional capability for Public Service, and adds the PUBLIC_SAFETY role to USS1 in the master list."
        - "UTM Authority vets USS1, then adds an entry to master USS list and assigns the USS_BASIC role."

FIMS_ADMIN:
    description: |
        This role enables an IT admin to maintain FIMS, for example by managing
        logfiles and servers via command line interface (CLI).  This role
        should not, in general, allow reading FIMS business data as knowledge
        of FIMS data is usually not needed to get the job done. Multi-Factor
        Authentication (MFA) should be enforced users with this role,
        and the number of users with this role should be minimized.
        This role is typically associated with a User whose authorization is out of band WRT FIMS oauth.
    authority: UTM_AUTHORITY
    examples:
        - "An IT admin manages FIMS-AZ logfiles."
        - "An IT admin reads the master USS list to update FIMS-AZ's data table containing the USSs, their scopes and their credentials."
    scopes:
        - utm.nasa.gov_read.fimsadmin

FIMS_SME:
    description: |
        A role is assigned to user who is a FIMS Subject Matter Expert (SME) who
        manages airspace constraints and other aeronautical data
        This user could be a client to the FIMS Ops server using a User Interface (rather than CLI).
        This role is typically associated with a user whose authorization is out of band WRT FIMS oauth.
    authority: ANSP
    examples:
        - "An airspace Subject Matter Expert composes an airspace constraint and submits this constraint to FIMS_OPS."

FIMS_AUTHZ:
    description: >-
        This is the service role supporting the FIMS Authorization server.
        This role cannot create, modify or delete UTM Identity data, rather access is read-only.
    authority: UTM_AUTHORITY
    examples:
        - "When FIMS AZ services the token endpoint, it reads a data table containing USS identities and their scopes."

USS_BASIC:
    description: A USS. The UTM Authority assigns role after
        out-of-band vetting. Vetting includes some testing mechanism and liability assumptions TBD.

        According to the ASTM Spec - 1.0
           - Client may perform planning, strategic conflict detection, conformance monitoring activities
                (including reading information about Constraints), and set the availability of USS in DSS

           - Client may read Constraints from the DSS (references) and partner USSs (details).
    authority: UTM_AUTHORITY
    examples:
        - "USS queries Discovery service to discover other USSs in its 4D area."
    scopes:
        - utm.strategic_coordination
        - utm.constraint_management
        - utm.constraint_processing
        - utm.conformance_monitoring_sa
        - utm.availability_arbitration

USS_CONSTRAINT_MANAGER:
    description: |
        A USS with this role can publish airspace constraints such as UASVolumeReservations (UVRs).
        The UTM Authority assigns this role after out-of-band
        vetting, which includes some testing mechanism and liability
        assumptions TBD.

        According to the ASTM Spec - 1.0
        - Client may manage (create, edit, and delete) Constraints they own.

    authority: UTM_AUTHORITY
    examples:
        - "A Public Safety USS, acting on behalf of the ANSP, adds an ASTM Contrating (aka UVR) to the UTM Network."
    scopes:
        - utm.constraint_management

USS_PUBLIC_SAFETY:
    description: |
        Not in ASTM Spec, rather driven by FAA UPP2
        - USS may perform a correlation query on behalf of a Public Service actor authorized for this category of ANSP data.
    authority: UTM_AUTHORITY
    examples:
        - "A Public Safety USS performs correlation query using an endpoint hosted by the FAA."
    scopes:
        - utm.faa.gov_read.publicsafety

USS_RID_DISPLAY:
    description: |

       According to the RID Interface  (todo)
    authority: UTM_AUTHORITY
    examples:
       - "A Public Safety USS performs Remote ID on behalf of the FAA."
    scopes:
       - dss.read.identification_service_areas

USS_RID_DISPLAY_ENHANCED:
    description: |

       According to the RID Interface
        

    authority: UTM_AUTHORITY
    examples:
       - "A Public Safety USS performs Remote ID on behalf of the FAA."
    scopes:
       - rid.read.enhanced_details
