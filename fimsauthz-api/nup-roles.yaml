# NUP Roles for FIMS-AZ

UTM_AUTHORITY:
    description: |
        A small set of trusted users who manage identities of all core UTM
        components such as USSs.
    authority: ANSP
    examples:
        - "UTM Authority vets USS1's additional capability for Public Service, and adds the PUBLIC_SAFETY role to USS1 in the master list."
        - "UTM Authority vets USS1, then adds an entry to master USS list and assigns the USS_BASIC role."

FIMS_ADMIN:
    description: |
        This role enables an IT admin to maintain FIMS, for example by managing
        logfiles and servers via command line interface (CLI).  This role
        should not, in general, allow reading FIMS business data as knowledge
        of FIMS data is usually not needed to get the job done. Multi-Factor
        Authentication (MFA) should be enforced users with this role,
        and the number of users with this role should be minimized.
        This role is typically associated with a User whose authorization is out of band WRT FIMS oauth.
    authority: UTM_AUTHORITY
    examples:
        - "An IT admin manages FIMS-AZ logfiles."
        - "An IT admin reads the master USS list to update FIMS-AZ's data table containing the USSs, their scopes and their credentials."
    scopes:
        - utm.nasa.gov_read.fimsadmin

FIMS_SME:
    description: |
        A role is assigned to user who is a FIMS Subject Matter Expert (SME) who
        manages airspace constraints and other aeronautical data
        This user could be a client to the FIMS Ops server using a User Interface (rather than CLI).
        This role is typically associated with a user whose authorization is out of band WRT FIMS oauth.
    authority: ANSP
    examples:
        - "An airspace Subject Matter Expert composes an airspace constraint and submits this constraint to FIMS_OPS."

FIMS_AUTHZ:
    description: >-
        This is the service role supporting the FIMS Authorization server.
        This role cannot create, modify or delete UTM Identity data, rather access is read-only.
    authority: UTM_AUTHORITY
    examples:
        - "When FIMS AZ services the token endpoint, it reads a data table containing USS identities and their scopes."

VEHICLE_AUTHORITY:
    authority: TBD; May be a set of trusted commercial entities
    description: |
        This role allows creation, modifcation and deletion of vehicle registrations.
        This role is typically associated with a user whose authentication and
        authorization is out of band WRT FIMS oauth.
        These users are small set of trusted vehicle subject matter experts who manage vehicle registrations.
    examples:
        - "A vehicle subject matter expert adds a new vehicle UVIN."

VEHICLE_REGISTRATION_CHECKER:
    description: |
        This is the service role supporting vehicle registration data providers.
        This role cannot create, modify or delete vehicle registrations.
    authority: VEHICLE_AUTHORITY
    examples:
        - "A vehicle registration data provider protects its endpoints with UTM uvin scopes."
        - "USS queries a vehicle data provider using its uvin scopes to check whethter a UVIN is registered."
        - "A Public Safety USS queries a vehicle data provider using its uvin scopes to learn the vehicle's owner."

USS_BASIC:
    description: A USS. The UTM Authority assigns role after
        out-of-band vetting. Vetting includes some testing mechanism and liability assumptions TBD.

        According to the ASTM Spec - 0.3.5
           - Client may perform planning, strategic conflict detection, and conformance monitoring activities,
                including reading information about Constraints.

           - Client may read Constraints from the DSS (references) and partner USSs (details).
    authority: UTM_AUTHORITY
    examples:
        - "USS queries Discovery service to discover other USSs in its 4D area."
    scopes:
        - utm.strategic_coordination
        - utm.constraint_consumption

USS_PUBLIC_SAFETY:
    description: |
        A USS with the capability to support public safety operations and queries.
        This role can be assigned only to a USS that has the
        USS_BASIC role. The UTM Authority assigns this role after out-of-band
        vetting, which includes some testing mechanism and liability
        assumptions TBD.
    authority: UTM_AUTHORITY
    examples:
        - "A Public Safety USS supports a public safety operation within the USS Network."
    scopes:
        - utm.nasa.gov_write.publicsafety

USS_PUBLIC_SAFETY_READ:
    description: |
        A USS with the capability to support public safety queries.
        This role can be assigned only to a USS that has the

        vetting.
    authority: UTM_AUTHORITY
    examples:
        - "A Public Safety USS queries other USSs to determine which USS is operating a particular vehicle."
        - "A Public Safety USS queries vehicle registration using its pubsafe scopes to learn the vehicle's owner."
    scopes:
        - utm.nasa.gov_read.publicsafety

USS_CONSTRAINT_MANAGER:
    description: |
        A USS with this role can publish airspace constraints such as UASVolumeReservations (UVRs).
        The UTM Authority assigns this role after out-of-band
        vetting, which includes some testing mechanism and liability
        assumptions TBD.

        - Client may manage (create, edit, and delete) Constraints they own.

    authority: UTM_AUTHORITY
    examples:
        - "A Public Safety USS performs correlation query using an endpoint hosted by the FAA."
