    properties:
      event_id:
        type: string
        description: >-
          A string tag indicating which event this operation is associated.
          Will be used to select a set of rules for validation.
        minLength: 1
        maxLength: 100
      test_identifiers:
        description: >-
          Specific tests ids supported by these data. These ids should map to
          specific tests as outlined in the overall event description. As
          an example, Event "TCL3_Demonstration" at a test site may have a
          test_card called "CARD_44". The operation associated with this
          metadata block may support "DAT2", "CNS1", and "CON4" specific tests.
          If any one of those elements are missing (event_id, test_card,
          test_identifiers), then data analysis may become difficult if not
          impossible.

      free_text:
        type: string
        description: >-
          Free text may be included with the original submission and/or added
          by a data_quality_engineer.  In the latter case, all previous
          free_text should be preserved, i.e. the data_quality_engineer should
          only append to the free_text field.
        maxLength: 3000
      data_quality_engineer:
        type: string
        format: email_address
        description: >-
          Email address of author handling data quality issue. If multiple
          individuals modify this metadata, this field will only hold the
          last such individual.  In that case, the engineer should make an
          effort to document as much as possible in the free_text field.
        maxLength: 150
      modified:
        type: boolean
        description: >-
          This metadata was modified from its original submission by a
          data_quality_engineer.
